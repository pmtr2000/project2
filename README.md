- Project requirments overview and description:




Build out your own Giphy search engine that:

    allows users to enter and submit a keyword
    makes a request to the Giphy api based on that keyword
    receives and parses the response
    displays images on the page from that response
    uses a custom css grid to display the images
    ensures the site is responsive so that it looks good/works well on both desktop and mobile devices



How to use it: 

    A user should be able to type in a search phrase, click submit, and your site should query the Giphy API based on the search expression that your users enter.  The results will be displayed and sized
