# Project2
Paul Trudeau
  
- Project requirments: build out your own Giphy search engine that:

allows users to enter and submit a keyword
makes a request to the Giphy api based on that keyword
receives and parses the response
displays images on the page from that response
uses a custom css grid to display the images
ensures the site is responsive so that it looks good/works well on both desktop and mobile devices

Planning phase

1) Create at least 3 user stories
2) Create wireframes for desktop and mobile views

 

Development phase

 

3) Create a GitHub repository on Github.com (before you start coding)
4) Clone it to your local machine (before you start coding)
5) You will need to obtain an API key through Giphy
6) Review the documentation for the "Search Endpoint"
7) Make frequent commits throughout your development that are descriptive, such as "adds todos reducer" (throughout development/coding process)

 

1) Your site only needs to contain one HTML page, but there should still be multiple links in your menu (even if they don't link to other pages)
2) There should be an input field (with a type of search) & a submit button
3) A user should be able to type in a search phrase, click submit, and your site should query the Giphy API based on the search expression that your users enter
4) Iterate through the returned data, and for each returned object in the array, find an image in the returned JSON and append that image to the screen
5) Your project should contain three files: index.html, style.scss, style.css and main.js and your project directory structure should look like picture below

Design

6) Your styling should all be done in your style.scss file (SASS), and you should use a CSS Preprocessor to watch that file for changes and output it to your style.css file. (Optional – for extra points. A solution with a simple CSS file is also accepted)

Site-wide

7) Choose a Google Font that you've never heard of before and use that to style your site title

Desktop

8) Use flex to ensure your site's name and nav bar appear aligned to the sides of the header (like in the screenshot below)
9) Use flex; to ensure your input field and submit button appear side by side
10) Create your own custom grid classes in css, that make use of the flex property, and leverage these in your code so that the images appear in rows and columns

Mobile (320px and below)

Use a @media query to ensure that:


11) Your site title and navbar stack vertically
12) Your navigation items stack vertically
13) Your images stack vertically in a single column
   
The following requirements are related to what your code should contain

2) There should be an input field (with a type of search) & a submit button
